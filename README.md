## `REPLIT FOLLOW BOT` `🤖`
There was a new feature released on replit as the replacement of cycles, which is followers. So I decided to abuse the power of following someone and create a follow bot just for replit, although you'll need account cookies, which can be created using my replit account generator, this is very fast and simple to use 🪄
